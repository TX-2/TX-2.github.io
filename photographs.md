## Lincoln Lab 2022-10-31 Release

I asked Lincoln Lab about release of photographs of the TX-2's
console.  On 2022-10-31 they kindly provided a number of photographs
of the computer in use and several parts of the console.  Some of
these photos are also included in the TX-2 Technical Manual, but they
are generally low-resolution cropped images.
