As described in the final report above, at the end of 1958, personnel
responsibile for the development of the SAGE system were transferred
to the MITRE Corporation.  The TX-2 continuted to be developed by
Lincoln Laboratory Division 5.

> A quarterly progress report (March - May 1961) of Lincoln Lab.,
> M.I.T. The FX-1 test computer was assembled. A partial checkout of

> being checked out, prior to installation. Barring unforeseen
> difficulties, FX-1, with its planned 0.2-microseconds read-write
> memory cycle time, will soon be in operation. Within the past
> quarter TX-2 was used on Projects MIDAS and Mercury, on a pattern
> recognition problem and by the Research Laboratory of Electronics
> (M.I.T.) on an adaptive programming problem. Work on sequential
> coding (SECO) for two-way communications systems continue in two
> phases: (1) the construction with evaluation of a single decoder,
> and (2) the design, construction and evaluation of a two-way
> system. A number of improvements in both the automatic speech
> recognition activity and in the programs for computer
> interpretations of natural English text (BASEBALL) were observed. A
> new version of the degarbler, a computer program for automatically
> correcting errors in English text, was developed which promises to
> correct substantially more errors than earlier versions.

Beginning 1965-05-15, the Quarterly Progress Report for Division 2 was
replaced by a Quarterly Technical Summary report on "General
Research".  It covered divisions 2 (Data Systems), 3 (Radio Physics),
4 (Radar), 7 (Engineering) and 8 (Solid State).
