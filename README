This is the documentation for the TX-2 project.  We aim to re-create
the historic TX-2 computer in emulation.

This documentation is hosted on-line at https://tx-2.github.io/.

The documentation "source" is in Markdown and this is converted (by
Jekyll) to HTML to be served on the web.  You can test this locally by
installing `bundle` and `jekyll` and running the command:

bundle exec jekyll serve
