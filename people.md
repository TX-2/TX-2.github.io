# People

This page contains some information about people who worked on the
TX-2.

### Clark, Wesley A.

Designer of the TX-2, LINC and other computers, and could reasonably
be credited with the creation of both the workstation (the TX-2) and
the minicomputer (LINC).  Wes also proposed (to Bob Taylor and Larry
Roberts) the idea of using IMPs to form a message swutching network
for the ARPANET.

   Engineering at UCSD (as stated in his [1964
dti  paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/800257.808886)).

### Roberts, Larry

An Internet Pioneer.  Created the ARPANET.

Roberts' Ph.D. thesis "[Machine Perception of Three-Dimensional
Solids](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11589)" was based on work
carried out on the TX-2.  Roberts is credited as the father of
Computer Vision as a result of this work.

Roberts wrote the TX-2's M4 assembler.

Roberts asked [Leonard Kleinrock](#leonard-kleinrock) to apply
mathematical methods to model and measure the performance of the
network.
