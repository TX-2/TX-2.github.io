# TX-2

> The MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer was the successor to the
> Lincoln TX-0 and was known for its role in advancing both artificial
> intelligence and humanâ€“computer interaction. Wesley A. Clark was the
> chief architect of the TX-2.

## Simulator Project

We're building a simulator for the TX-2 machine.  To do this, we need
documentation and, if we can discover some, example code.   If you
know of example code or documentation which is not linked below,
please let us know.

### Goals

We'd like to make it possible once more to run the historically
important [Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) program
by Ivan Sutherland.

### The Importance of Sketchpad

Sketchpad was a pioneering work in Human-Computer Interaction,
computer graphics and computer-aided design.  The graphical user
interface and object-oriented programming were both pioneered by
Sketchpad.  Sketchpad also made use of constraints for manipulating
the elements of the drawing.

Ivan Sutherland received the Turing Award in 1988 and the Kyoto Prize
in 2012.


## Documentation

The main categories of documentation are:

1. Documentation produced by the TX-2 project itself.  For example
   explanation of the planned design, reference information for
   maintenance and documentation intended for TX-2 programmers.
1. Papers published by people who wrote software on and for the TX-2;
   Ivan Sutherland's thesis, for example.
1. Proposals, progress reports, and other administrative documentation
   relating to the TX-2 project and Lincoln Lab.  This mostly does not
   contain information of directly technical use, but can help
   establish the timing of changes and the motivation for changes.
1. Retrospectives of the TX-2 project and programs such as Sketchpad.
