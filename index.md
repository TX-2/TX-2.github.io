# TX-2

> The MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer was the successor to the
> Lincoln TX-0 and was known for its role in advancing both artificial
> intelligence and humanâ€“computer interaction. Wesley A. Clark was the
> chief architect of the TX-2.

## Simulator Project

We're building a simulator for the TX-2 machine.  To do this, we need
documentation and, if we can discover some, example code.  If you know
of documentation which is not linked from our [documentation
page](documentation), please [let us know](#contacting-us).

Our most pressing need is for authentic TX-2 [software](software);
without software to run the simulator will not be very useful, and
without authentic software, we cannot be confident that the simulation
is accurate.

## Try It Out

You can [try the simulator out in your
browser](https://tx-2.github.io/demo/).  This is still a
work-in-progress; many parts are incomplete.

The [source code for the simulator is on
github](https://github.com/TX-2/TX-2-simulator).  You can use this to
run the simulator locally.  See the [build instructions for the
web-based
simulator](https://github.com/TX-2/TX-2-simulator/blob/main/docs/build/web.md).

## Goals

We'd like to make it possible once more to run historically
important programs including

* The [Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) program by
  [Ivan Sutherland](people#ivan-sutherland).
* The network simulation program written by [Leonard
  Kleinrock](people#leonard-kleinrock)
  to investigate digital networking.

### The Importance of Sketchpad

Sketchpad was a pioneering work in Human-Computer Interaction,
computer graphics and computer-aided design.  The graphical user
interface and object-oriented programming were both pioneered by
Sketchpad.  Sketchpad also made use of constraints for manipulating
the elements of the drawing.

Ivan Sutherland received the Turing Award in 1988 and the Kyoto Prize
in 2012.
