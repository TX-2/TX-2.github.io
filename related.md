# Related Work

This page contains some information about related work and material,
but which are not about the TX-2 itself.  See also the
[Documentation](documentation) page; it also includes related
information.

The [Videos](videos) page also contains some lectures by and about
people involved with the TX-2, and several of those also include
information about related systems and work.  The [People](people) page
contains information about the people who worked on the TX-2.

### Whirlwind

The Whirlwind project at Lincoln Laboratory developed the Whirlwind 1
computer, the predecessor of the TX-0 and TX-2.  The Whirlwind 2
evolved into the [United States Air Force SAGE air defense
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment).
