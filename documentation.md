# TX-2 Documentation

## Contents
* TOC
{:toc}

The main categories of documentation are:

1. Documentation produced by the TX-2 project itself.  For example
   explanation of the planned design, reference information for
   maintenance and documentation intended for TX-2 programmers.
1. Papers published by people who wrote software on and for the TX-2;
   Ivan Sutherland's thesis, for example.
1. Proposals, progress reports, and other administrative documentation
   relating to the TX-2 project and Lincoln Lab.  This mostly does not
   contain information of directly technical use, but can help
   establish the timing of changes and the motivation for changes.
1. Retrospectives of the TX-2 project and programs such as Sketchpad.
1. Project documentation, including [commentary](commentary) on the
   primary sources.

There are also some related [photographs](photographs.md) and [videos](videos).

## How You Can Help

If you know of additional material that's not listed here, please let
us know (for example by email to james@youngman.org).  Even if you
can't give it to us directly (e.g. because Lincoln Lab would need to
release it), it will be useful for us to know that it exists.

## Documentation Highlights

The [TX-2 Technical Manual](#TM) is the key reference work on the
workings of the TX2, while the [User Handbook](#UH) is the first place
to look for the kind of information a programmer would need to know.

## Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 Project Documentation

Lincoln Laboratory Division 6 was responsible for the development of
the TX-2.  Their memos normally begin with the digit 6.

### Introductory and Overview Material

1. Papers presented at the February 1957 Western Joint Computer
   Conference  (Los Angeles, California) by members of the TX-2
   project.
   * This gives an overview of the system, though some details
   (e.g. some details of the instruction word and the main memory
   store) changed subsequently.
   * Available from [bitsavers.org](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/tx-2/TX-2_Papers_WJCC_57.pdf).

   * These papers include:
	 * The Lincoln TX-2 Computer Development.  Wesley A. Clark.
     * A Functional Description of the Lincoln TX-2
       Computer. J. M. Frankovich and H. P. Peterson.
     * The Lincoln TX-2 Input-Output System.  James W. Forgie.

	 * TX-2 Circuitry.  Kenneth H. Olsen.
1. TX-2 Introductory Notes, A. Vanderburgh, 24 February 1959.
   * This document is particularly important because it contains a
     clear description of the operation of deferred addressing (on
     page 23).  I have not seen a full and clear description of this
     elsewhere.
   * From [TX-2 Materials, 1959-1960, Box: 8. United States government
     computing collection, CBI 63. Charles Babbage Institute
     Archives](https://archives.lib.umn.edu/repositories/3/archival_objects/545729).
1. Some Examples of TX-2 Programming, H. Philip Peterson, July 1958.  Also known as Memorandum 6M-5780.
   These appear to have been prepared before some significant parts of
   the design (such as the address of the A register) were changed.

   1971, Volume 14 Number
   10](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/362759.362810); this
   describes the use of the sync system with the TX-2's APEX
   time-sharing system.  Includes some details of the implementation
   of the sync system.

### TX-2 Users Handbook {#UH}

The handbook describes the system's instruction set, peripherals and
some operational procedures and details (e.g. console controls and
indicators).  It also describes the system assembler, includes a
listing of the customary set-up of the boot code in the A and B
plug boards.

### APEX

APEX was introduced in 1964 and was a system for time-sharing on the
TX-2.

Sketchpad pre-dates APEX.  Sketchpad is our primary focus for the
simulator.  The BCPL compiler used APEX, but we don't have details of
APEX or a copy of the BCPL compiler.

   Computer History Museum; catalog number 102726903.
   * The listings come in two documents.  Large sections of these are
     illegible.  These listings appear to have been printed on the
     TX-2's Xerox printer and then photocopied.  Many of the key
     details of the listing are unrecognizable blobs.  TX-2 assembly
     language makes extensive use of superscripts and subscripts, and
     the small size of these has meant that the photocopying did not
     always come out well.
