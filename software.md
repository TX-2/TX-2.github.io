# TX-2 Software

The project currently has no access to any machine-readable copies of
any software for the TX-2 at all.

**This is the project's most pressing need**.  If you think you may be
able to help in any way, please [let us
know](README#contacting-us).

With authentic software, we can test the simulator and demonstrate
that it is a credible re-creation of the TX-2 machine.

## Listings we Have Already

* [Some Examples of TX-2
  Programming](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/tx-2/6M-5780_Some_Examples_of_TX-2_Programming_Jul1958.pdf),
  H. Philip Peterson, July 1958.
   * Some short programs demonstrating how the planned machine was
     intended to work.
* Listings in the [Users
  Handbook](documentation#tx-2-users-handbook) provide the boot
  code and the standard paper tape reader leader.
* [A listing of
  Sketchpad](https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102726903).
  This unfortunately is illegible in places, and so we very much want
  to obtain additional listings for comparison purposes.  Or of
  course much better, a machine-readable version.

## We Need Machine-Readable Code

Known-good machine-readable code would act as a reality-check for our
understanding of the TX-2.  This would allow us to complete the
simulator with come confidence about its correctness.

If we can be reasonably confident about the correctness of the
simulator, then it may become tractable to try to reconstruct the
illegible portions of the Sketchpad listing.  This of course would be
a huge task.

If we could obtain a machine-readable copy of the Sketchpad code, this
would allow us to make that program run again for the first
time in decades.

Having a machine-readable version of the Sketchpad code would by
itself be an immensely valuable thing for the study of the history of
computing.

## Software that Once Existed

We have seen mention of various pieces of TX-2 software, though we
don't currently have a copy of any of these:

1. Sketchpad (see above) by Ivan Sutherland
1. Sketchpad-III by Timothy Edward Johnson
1. The TX-2 BCPL compiler by Martin Richards, Henry Ancona et al.
1. [The LO Text
   formatter](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA007824.pdf)
1. Bill Sutherland's program for the [on-line graphical specification
   of computer
   procedures](https://mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?vid=01MIT_INST:MIT&search_scope=all&tab=all&docid=alma990002681740106761&lang=en&context=L&virtualBrowse=true)
1. The M4 assembler
1. The [APEX](documentation#apex) time-sharing executive
